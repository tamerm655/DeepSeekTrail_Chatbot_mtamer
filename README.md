# DeepSeekTrail Cahtbot

This repository contains a chatbot that retrieves and generates responses using ChromaDB for vector search. The system is designed to work with structured document retrieval, ensuring that responses are accurate and context-aware.

## Features

- **Flask API**: Handles requests, processes user input, and retrieves relevant information.
- **Streamlit Interface**: A simple web-based UI for interacting with the chatbot.
- **ChromaDB for Vector Search**: Stores document embeddings and retrieves relevant chunks based on similarity.
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines ChromaDB’s vector search with keyword-based filtering.
- **Overlapping Sliding Window & Semantic Chunking**: Improves retrieval accuracy by splitting documents into meaningful sections.
- **Re-ranking**: Uses free tools like `text-embedding-ada-002` to improve search results.
- **Direct Answer Mode**: If an exact match is found, the chatbot returns the text without involving the LLM.
- **Self-Verification**: The LLM cross-checks its own answers to improve reliability.
- **Debugging View**: Displays retrieved text chunks for transparency.
- **LangChain’s RetrievalQA**: Manages document retrieval and response generation.

## Setup
